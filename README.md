# Analyzing-the-US-Bikeshare-Data
Analyzing the bike sharing system dataset across major cities in the US


In this project, data was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The scope of this analysis also covers the comparision of the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
